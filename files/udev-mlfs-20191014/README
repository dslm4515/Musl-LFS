The udev-mlfs set of files is a customization of systemd.
In 2012, udev was merged with systemd and a build methodology
incompatible with LFS.  These files add cusom udev rules
for MLFS.

These files are distributed in the form of a tar file available
from the LFS file mirrors.  The tarball is created with:

mkdir /tmp/udev-lfs-$VERSION
cp -av * /tmp/udev-lfs-$VERSION
tar -jcf /tmp/udev-lfs-$VERSION.tar.bz2 -C /tmp udev-lfs-$VERSION

Makefile.mlfs        - The MLFS Makefile.  Installs udev rules for MLFS.
