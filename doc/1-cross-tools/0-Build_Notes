# General Build Notes for cross-tools

# This small tool chain will be used to create another tool chain (tools)
# that will use Musl libc instead of the default of GLIBC. Once the /tools
# is built, /cross-tools will not longer be used for the rest of the build.

# Cross-tools is not sandboxed and will depend on libraries and binaries
# found in the host. Therefore cross-tools built on a Glibc host will not
# run/work on a Musl host and vice verssa.

# In general, fixes and patches will not be applied to most packages as this  
# tool chain will not be used for the final build. Cross-tools should be 
# built by the mlfs user and not root. 

# Each package should be unpacked in /mnt/mlfs/source, and change 
# to the unpacked source directory. For example:
cd /mnt/mfls/sources
tar xf pkgs/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz
cd foo-1.2.3

# Then patch and compile per instruction
patch -Np1 -i ../patches/foo-mlfs/fix-it.patch
./configure --prefix=/cross-tools
make
make install

# After the package is installed, change directories and remove
# unpacked source directory unless instructed:
cd ..
rm -rf foo-1.2.3
