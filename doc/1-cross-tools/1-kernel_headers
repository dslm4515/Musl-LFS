# Cross-Tools: Kernel Headers
# Build & install as user mlfs

# Clean sources
make mrproper

# Install

## For kernel up to 5.2.x:
# make ARCH=${MLFS_ARCH} INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/cross-tools/${MLFS_TARGET} headers_install

## For kernels 5.3.x+:
make ARCH=${MLFS_ARCH} headers
mkdir -pv /cross-tools/${MLFS_TARGET}/include

cp -rv usr/include/* /cross-tools/${MLFS_TARGET}/include

# Remove unnecessary files that don't need to be in /cross-tools/.../include
# directory
# Note: .*.cmd files are extremely useful when compiling the entire kernel,
# since they're avoid unnecessary invocations of GNU make.
# But, since we just need the headers, we can delete them from our
# cross-toolchain.
