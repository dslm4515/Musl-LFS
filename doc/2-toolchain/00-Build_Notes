# General Build Notes for tools

# This small tool chain will be used to create the final optimized system.
# Once the /tools is built, /cross-tools will not longer be used for the 
# rest of the build. This tool chain was designed to be sandboxed and has
# its own libc. * This should still be bult by mlfs user and not root.*

# In general, some fixes and patches will be applied to 
# packages as this tool chain will be used for the final build. 

# **************************************************************************
# * This is also a good time to choose a package manager/system for 
# * creating, deploying, and managing packages. Since package management
# * is outide the scope of this project, it will not be discussed here nor
# * will a package system be used when building the final system.
# **************************************************************************
# For example, Slackware's pkgtools can be used. Refer to:
# https://github.com/dslm4515/MLFS-pkgtool

# Each package should be unpacked in /mnt/mlfs/source, and change 
# to the unpacked source directory. For example:
cd /mnt/mlfs/sources
tar xf pkgs/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz
cd foo-1.2.3

# Then patch and compile per instruction
patch -Np1 -i ../patches/foo-mlfs/fix-it.patch
./configure --prefix=/tools
make
make install

# After the package is installed, change directories and remove
# unpacked source directory unless instructed:
cd ..
rm -rf foo-1.2.3
