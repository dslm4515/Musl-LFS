# The End

# It may be a good idea to create an /etc/lfs-release file. By having this 
# file, it is very easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at 
# some point) to find out which LFS version is installed on the system. 
# Create this file by running: 
echo 7.0 > /etc/mlfs-release

# It is also a good idea to create a file to show the status of your new 
# system with respect to the Linux Standards Base (LSB). To create this file, run: 
cat > /etc/lsb-release << "EOF"
DISTRIB_ID="Musl Linux From Scratch"
DISTRIB_RELEASE="7.0"
DISTRIB_CODENAME="<your name here>"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Musl Linux From Scratch"
EOF

## Rebooting the System 

# Exit chroot and unmount MLFS
logout
umount -v $MLFS/dev/pts
umount -v $MLFS/dev
umount -v $MLFS/run
umount -v $MLFS/proc
umount -v $MLFS/sys

# Unmount if MLFS is on a seperate partition or HDD/SDD/device
umount -v $MLFS

# You may reboot your machine [if host and target are the same]
