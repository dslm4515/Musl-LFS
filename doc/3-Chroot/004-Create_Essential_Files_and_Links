# Create Essential Files and Symlinks
# This section is done in Chroot environment

# Some programs use hard-wired paths to programs 
# which do not exist yet. In order to satisfy 
# these programs, create a number of symbolic 
# links which will be replaced by real files 
# throughout the course of this chapter after 
# the software has been installed: 
ln -sv /tools/bin/{bash,cat,dd,echo,ln,pwd,rm,stty} /bin
ln -sv /tools/bin/{install,perl} /usr/bin
ln -sv /tools/lib/libgcc_s.so{,.1} /usr/lib
ln -sv /tools/lib/libstdc++.{a,so{,.6}} /usr/lib
ln -sv bash /bin/sh 

# Historically, Linux maintains a list of the 
# mounted file systems in the file /etc/mtab. 
# Modern kernels maintain this list internally 
# and exposes it to the user via the /proc 
# filesystem. To satisfy utilities that expect 
# the presence of /etc/mtab, create the 
# following symbolic link: 
ln -sv /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab

# In order for user root to be able to login 
# and for the name “root” to be recognized, 
# there must be relevant entries in the 
# /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.

# To remove the "I have no name!" prompt, start 
# a new shell:
exec /tools/bin/bash --login +h

# The login, agetty, and init programs (and others) 
# use a number of log files to record information 
# such as who was logged into the system and when. 
# However, these programs will not write to the 
# log files if they do not already exist. 
# Initialize the log files and give them proper 
# permissions: 
touch /var/log/{btmp,lastlog,faillog,wtmp}
chgrp -v utmp /var/log/lastlog
chmod -v 664  /var/log/lastlog
chmod -v 600  /var/log/btmp
