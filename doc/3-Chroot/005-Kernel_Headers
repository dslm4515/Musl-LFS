# Final System: Kernel Headers
# Use latest kernel version when possible
# This section is done in Chroot environment

# Clean source tree
make mrproper

# Extract headers
# !! The recommended make target “headers_install” cannot
# !! be used, because it requires rsync, which is not
# !! available in /tools. The headers are first placed in ./usr
#
# For kernels up to 5.2.x:
#make INSTALL_HDR_PATH=dest headers_install

# Kernel version greater than 5.9.16 will not compile under musl 
patch -Np1 -i ../patches/kernel/include-uapi-linux-swab-Fix-potentially-missing-__always_inline.patch 

# For kernels 5.3.x and newer:
make headers

# Install Headers
# Kernel up to 5.2.x:
# cp -rv dest/include/* /usr/include

# Kernels 5.2.x and newer:
cp -rv usr/include/* /usr/include

# After installed, there still are also some hidden
# files used by the kernel developers (for what?)
# and not needed by MLFS that now can be removed
# from our /usr/include.
find /usr/include -name '.*' -exec rm -vf {} \; 

# The Makefile present also won't be used
rm -v /usr/include/Makefile
